# Assignment 01 - Spam Detector
> Course: CSCI 2020U: Software Systems Development and Integration

This is the template for your Assignment 01.

## Collaboration Policy 
You are permitted to work on this assignment in a team, and submit the results as a team. For this sort of assignment, with an open-ended component, the collaboration between multiple team members can be beneficial. Between groups, however, please limit the discussion to the level of general strategy (not code). **Groups of size 2 are recommended**. In any case, be sure that all members of the team fully understand all code, otherwise they will miss intended learning objectives, which may be a considerable disadvantage at other assessments. 

## Overview
You have become frustrated with all the advertisements in your inbox. You resolve to create a spam detector to filter out the spam. The spam detector will use a dataset of E-Mails (spam or otherwise) to train your program to recognize whether or not new E-Mails are spam. The program will use a unigram approach [1], where each word is counted and associated with whether or not the message is spam. Your program will calculate probabilities based on each wordâ€™s frequency [2]. Luckily, you have not emptied your spam folder or inbox in quite a while, so you have many samples to use to train your system.
