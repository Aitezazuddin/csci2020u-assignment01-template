# Project Information
This project is a spam detection web application that utilizes a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or ham (not spam). The model was built using Python and trained on a dataset of labeled emails. The web application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allows users to upload a file containing emails to be classified as spam or ham.

## Improvements
In addition to the basic requirements, made several improvements to the spam detector:
Improved the user interface with a more modern and clean design
Added the ability to upload text files to classify them
Incorporated regular expression filtering to improve accuracy

### To run the spam detector, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/OntarioTech-CS-program/csci2020u-assignment01-template.git
Install the necessary dependencies: npm install
Start the server: npm start
